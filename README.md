# Simple Quiz App

A simple Quiz app, with some categories and result system. 

## Purpose

This is created just for practice, following a tutorial; It has a lot of components, and a little of complexity but it was really cool to code.

### What you can find in this project

You'll be able to do some quizzes (not all categories have a quiz), you can slide through every question and you'll see an indicator if your answer is correct or incorrect. There's a timer with a fixed countdown and after you finish the quiz, you'll see a results grid with all answers (unanswered, answered and incorrect), followed by a grade based in the number of correct answers. I used the following libraries and assets:

* Navgation View
* ViewPager and TabLayout for the question's fragments
* ReciclerView to load the question's list
* Fragments
* CardView for loading category list
* SQLite for handling question and answers database
* CountDownTimer class
* Broadcast Receiver

This app still have some issues, so I'll fix them eventually.
